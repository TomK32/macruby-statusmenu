macruby-statusmenu example

This example application written in MacRuby shows you how to write a 
simple application that sits in your system's status menu.
It also displays a custom view that you can style with images and stuff
in this status menu.
The app is set to run as agent meaning it won't show in the Dock Menu when running.
